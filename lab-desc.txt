My lab will be using VMware Workstation Pro 12.5, running on Windows 10. Vagrant is installed on Windows and is using a simple Ubuntu Server 14.04 image to create an NMS VM running git and Ansible, with Jinja2 and NAPALM libraries also installed. I am also using Bash for Windows, and I have git installed within the Ubuntu shell, because face it, Windows sucks for dev stuff.

For the network devices I will be using Cisco VIRL running predominantly L2 images (as my project goal is to automate the addition and removal of VLANs from trunks). The NMS server is connected to the flat management network as as such has access to management subnet for all devices in VIRL.
